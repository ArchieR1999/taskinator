# Taskinator
This is a class example of what is known as a 'Kanban' board. It takes user input and that is placed in one of three columns which is a task list or a to-do list. 

## How it works
Once you write an input in the text field and select a category from the dropdown, the task is added to the list. Users can change columns the item lies in by selecting the individual task and changing the options from whatever they can see. Additionally, users can edit tasks by clicking edit and then changing the text field and caterogries from the top, saving with the "submit" button. Tasks can be deleted by clicking delete. Finally, once the page is refreshed, the inputs are saved in localStorage and are retreived as they were left, so the user's work remains on the board.
